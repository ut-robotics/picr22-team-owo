# OWO mainboard documentation

## General information

### Power
The mainboard is split into 2 isolated sides with seperate ground planes.
The microcontroller side is powered with 5V by an USB connector that is stepped down to 3.3V by a 5V to 3.3V voltage regulator (NCP164CSN330T1G). 
The motor driver side is powered by a 4S LIPO battery (up to 16.8V) and is stepped down to 5V to power the isolators and servos 
using a buck converter (TPS62933DRLR). Both the buck converter and voltage regulator have power LEDs.
The board can power 3 brushed DC motors with up to 3A each, its encoders, 2 servos and one external IR sensor and IR LED.

### Communications and signal
The microcontroller can be programmed using the programmer connector and can communicate through the USB connector. 
The motor drivers recieve a nsleep signal from the microcontroller to wake up and are controlled using a PWM and direction signal.
The 2 isolated sides are connected via 3 isolators (MAX14930DASE+).
