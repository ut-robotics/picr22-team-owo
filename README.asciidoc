== Programming:
The robot will automatically connect to the pwir wifi. Then it can be accessed via ssh using the hostname OWO. Refer to software/readme.asciidoc for more details and how to run the code.

External libraries used:

* evdev - Handling communication with XBox One S remote controller (over bluetooth)
* numba - Speeding up Python code
* numpy - Calculations, image processing
* pyrealsense2 - Configuring and using the RealSense 2 camera on the robot
* pyserial - Serial communication with the Mainboard
* websocket-client - For creating and handling websocket connection to the referee server

*Sander:* +
On which parts of the robot did you work on? +
I worked on mechanics: designing, manufacturing and assembling. +
What I learned? +
I learned to use Fusion 360 and how to export necessary files to actually manufacture components. Also learned how to use CNC-mill, lathe and 3D-printer. +
What I liked about the course? +
I liked that we needed to make actual robot from scratch and learned how to use CNC-mill, lathe and 3D-printer. +
What would you do differently next time? +
I would make the robot a bit bigger and wheels smaller to make it easier to turn. Also would improve the thrower design to make it smaller and more efficent. +
Suggestions for next year students? +
Make the sketch so that important dimensions can be changed easily and find enough time for this project from the beginning of the course. +
Suggestions for instructors? +
Instructors usually answered quite quickly, but sometimes you had to wait several weeks for an answer.  +
